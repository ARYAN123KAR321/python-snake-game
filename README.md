## Introduction

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. This project is a Python implementation of the game, using the Pygame library for graphics and game logic.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score as you eat food.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the game ends, a game over screen is displayed with your final score.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily modify game settings such as snake speed, window size, and colors.

## Installation

To run the Python Snake Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARYAN123KAR321/python-snake-game.git
   cd python-snake-game
   ```

2. **Install Pygame**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the Pygame library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   After installing Pygame, you can run the game by executing the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Run the `snake_game.py` script to start the game.
- **Controls**:
  - **Arrow Up**: Move the snake upwards.
  - **Arrow Down**: Move the snake downwards.
  - **Arrow Left**: Move the snake to the left.
  - **Arrow Right**: Move the snake to the right.
- **Objective**: Eat the food (represented by a red square) to grow the snake and increase your score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Your final score will be displayed on the screen.
